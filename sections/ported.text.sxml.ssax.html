      <p node-type="paragraph"><code node-type="code">(text sxml *)</code> libraries are the adaptation of Oleg Kiselyov's
SXML framework SSAX, which is based on S-expression representation of XML
structure.</p>
      <p node-type="paragraph">SSAX is a parser part of SXML framework.</p>
      <p node-type="paragraph">This is a quote from SSAX webpage:</p>
      <blockquote node-type="blockquote">
        <p node-type="paragraph">The framework consists of a DOM/SXML parser, a SAX parser, and a supporting
library of lexing and parsing procedures. The procedures in the package can be
used separately to tokenize or parse various pieces of XML documents. The
framework supports XML Namespaces, character, internal and external parsed
entities, xml:space, attribute value normalization, processing instructions and
CDATA sections. The package includes a semi-validating SXML parser: a DOM-mode
parser that is an instantiation of a SAX parser (called SSAX).
The parsing framework offers support for XML validation, to the full or any
user-specified degree. Framework's procedures by themselves detect great many
validation errors and almost all well-formedness errors. Furthermore, a user is
given a chance to set his own handlers to capture the rest of the errors.
Content is validated given user-specified constraints, which the user can derive
from a DTD, from an XML schema, or from other competing doctype specification
formats.
SSAX is a full-featured, algorithmically optimal, pure-functional parser, which
can act as a stream processor. SSAX is an efficient SAX parser that is easy to
use. SSAX minimizes the amount of application-specific state that has to be
shared among user-supplied event handlers. SSAX makes the maintenance of an
application-specific element stack unnecessary, which eliminates several classes
of common bugs. SSAX is written in a pure-functional subset of Scheme. Therefore,
the event handlers are referentially transparent, which makes them easier for a
programmer to write and to reason about. The more expressive, reliable and easier
to use application interface for the event-driven XML parsing is the outcome of
implementing the parsing engine as an enhanced tree fold combinator, which fully
captures the control pattern of the depth-first tree traversal.</p>

          <a name="Introduction">Introduction</a>
        </h3>
        <p node-type="paragraph">I derived the content of this part of the manual from SSAX source code, just by
converting its comments into this manual format. The original text is by Oleg
Kiselyov.</p>
        <p node-type="paragraph">This is a package of low-to-high level lexing and parsing procedures
that can be combined to yield a SAX, a DOM, a validating parsers, or
a parser intended for a particular document type. The procedures in
the package can be used separately to tokenize or parse various
pieces of XML documents. The package supports XML Namespaces,
internal and external parsed entities, user-controlled handling of
whitespace, and validation. This module therefore is intended to be
a framework, a set of "Lego blocks" you can use to build a parser
following any discipline and performing validation to any degree. As
an example of the parser construction, this file includes a
semi-validating SXML parser.</p>
        <p node-type="paragraph">The present XML framework has a "sequential" feel of SAX yet a
"functional style" of DOM. Like a SAX parser, the framework scans
the document only once and permits incremental processing. An
application that handles document elements in order can run as
efficiently as possible. <i node-type="i">Unlike</i> a SAX parser, the framework does
not require an application register stateful callbacks and surrender
control to the parser. Rather, it is the application that can drive
the framework -- calling its functions to get the current lexical or
syntax element. These functions do not maintain or mutate any state
save the input port. Therefore, the framework permits parsing of XML
in a pure functional style, with the input port being a monad (or a
linear, read-once parameter).</p>
        <p node-type="paragraph">Besides the PORT, there is another monad -- SEED. Most of the
middle- and high-level parsers are single-threaded through the
seed. The functions of this framework do not process or affect the
SEED in any way: they simply pass it around as an instance of an
opaque datatype.  User functions, on the other hand, can use the
seed to maintain user's state, to accumulate parsing results, etc. A
user can freely mix his own functions with those of the
framework. On the other hand, the user may wish to instantiate a
high-level parser: ssax:make-elem-parser or ssax:make-parser.  In
the latter case, the user must provide functions of specific
signatures, which are called at predictable moments during the
parsing: to handle character data, element data, or processing
instructions (PI). The functions are always given the SEED, among
other parameters, and must return the new SEED.</p>
        <p node-type="paragraph">From a functional point of view, XML parsing is a combined
pre-post-order traversal of a "tree" that is the XML document
itself. This down-and-up traversal tells the user about an element
when its start tag is encountered. The user is notified about the
element once more, after all element's children have been
handled. The process of XML parsing therefore is a fold over the
raw XML document. Unlike a fold over trees defined in [1], the
parser is necessarily single-threaded -- obviously as elements
in a text XML document are laid down sequentially. The parser
therefore is a tree fold that has been transformed to accept an
accumulating parameter [1,2].</p>
        <p node-type="paragraph">Formally, the denotational semantics of the parser can be expressed
as</p>
        <pre lang="scheme" node-type="block"><code>parser:: (Start-tag -&gt; Seed -&gt; Seed) -&gt;
	 (Start-tag -&gt; Seed -&gt; Seed -&gt; Seed) -&gt;
	 (Char-Data -&gt; Seed -&gt; Seed) -&gt;
	 XML-text-fragment -&gt; Seed -&gt; Seed

parser fdown fup fchar "&lt;elem attrs&gt; content &lt;/elem&gt;" seed
 = fup "&lt;elem attrs&gt;" seed
	(parser fdown fup fchar "content" (fdown "&lt;elem attrs&gt;" seed))

parser fdown fup fchar "char-data content" seed
 = parser fdown fup fchar "content" (fchar "char-data" seed)

parser fdown fup fchar "elem-content content" seed
 = parser fdown fup fchar "content" (
	parser fdown fup fchar "elem-content" seed)
</code></pre>
        <p node-type="paragraph">Compare the last two equations with the left fold
fold-left kons elem:list seed = fold-left kons list (kons elem seed)</p>
        <p node-type="paragraph">The real parser created my ssax:make-parser is slightly more complicated,
to account for processing instructions, entity references, namespaces,
processing of document type declaration, etc.</p>
        <p node-type="paragraph">The XML standard document referred to in this module is
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-xml-19980210.html">http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-xml-19980210.html</a>The present file also defines a procedure that parses the text of an
XML document or of a separate element into SXML, an
S-expression-based model of an XML Information Set. SXML is also an
Abstract Syntax Tree of an XML document. SXML is similar
but not identical to DOM; SXML is particularly suitable for
Scheme-based XML/HTML authoring, SXPath queries, and tree
transformations. See SXML.html for more details.
SXML is a term implementation of evaluation of the XML document [3].
The other implementation is context-passing.</p>
